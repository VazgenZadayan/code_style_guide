## Reflection

  - The idea for this project came to me because I work in a large team, with different people, technical ability and style. 
  - I wanted to create something that would make our code identical, more readable and beautiful.
  - So I decided to create an application that any developer can visit and get acquainted with the code style of our company, as well as understand the architecture and the file structure of the applications that have been and will be created by our company.
